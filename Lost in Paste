Lost in Paste (Medium)

Description:
  CipherFoxx used to post travel notes and sometimes dumps them on public paste sites. One post disappeared — find the dump, follow the trail, and recover the missing flag.

Solution:
  Search public pastes/gists for CipherFoxx (e.g., Pastebin/Gist).
  Extract the broken blog URL from that paste.
  Paste the URL into the Wayback Machine (archive.org) and open the archived snapshot.
  Search for the flag in the github or in the file provided in the broken link

Flag:
  ACNCTF{404_not_forgotten}

Hints:
  CipherFoxx leaves crumbs on paste sites.
  A 404 isn’t gone if the archive remembers.
