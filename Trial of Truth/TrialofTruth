Trial of Truth (Medium)

Description:
  A cropped photo of a historic building hides more than it shows. Listen to the whispers of the past — a single figure and a pivotal year may hold the key.

Solution:

  Hidden caption appears: “They say one man stood here against thirty years of silence.”
  Find where the photo was taken

Hints:
  Check where most travelers don’t look — the story hides in the details.
  The key combines a person and the year history remembers.
