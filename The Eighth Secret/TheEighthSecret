The Eighth Secret (Hard)


Description:
	A quiet corner hides more than old bricks and trees — find the square, listen to what locals say, and uncover the district’s hidden signature.


Solution:
	Identify the shop sign “Vegyes Kereskedés” → initials vk.

	On Google Maps at Kálvária tér, find the shop and check its reviews → one review hints at the district.

	District = Józsefváros → combine

Hint 1: “Shops don’t just sell things — sometimes their names matter.”
Hint 2: “The map shows locations, but reviews reveal whispers.”
Hint 3: “Think initials from the shop and the district name where Kálvária tér belongs.”
