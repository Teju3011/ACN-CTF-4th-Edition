#  Forecast Grid

**Category:** Crypto — Easy  

---

## Story
Meteorologists left encoded notes about strange weather patterns. One page contains an encoded run of text — the forecast grid. Can you decode it and find the flag?

---

## Files
- `challenge/ciphertext.txt` — the Vigenère-encrypted message (ciphertext).  
- `hint1` — The storm scribbles are not random — the letters repeat in a cycle, like drops falling in rhythm. Think about grids where rows shift against each other.
 
- `hint2` — Forecasts are often written with four simple letters. Look up, and you will find what keeps pouring down again and again.

## Goal & Flag format
The ciphertext is produced with a Vigenère cipher.
