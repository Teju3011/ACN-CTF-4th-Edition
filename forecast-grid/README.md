## Story
Meteorologists left encoded notes about strange weather patterns. One page contains an encoded run of text — the forecast grid. Can you decode it and find the flag?

## Files
- `challenge/ciphertext.txt` — the encrypted message.
- `hint1` — That jumble of letters looks like internet luggage — reverse the packaging that makes data safe for text transfer.

- `hint2` — The cipher’s key repeats like a weather pattern; think short, common, and four letters long — its beat matches falling drops.

## Goal & Flag format
The ciphertext is produced with a Base64 and Vigenère cipher.
