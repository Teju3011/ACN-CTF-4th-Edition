# Verilog Flag Checker

We found a mysterious hardware design written in Verilog. It seems to transform characters through some "magic" logic blocks, and the testbench (`t_chall.v`) contains a sequence of numbers that looks importantâ€¦

## Challenge

Files provided:
- `magic.v`
- `chall.v`
- `t_chall.v`

Your task: analyze the Verilog modules, figure out how they transform inputs, and use the given data in `t_chall.v` to recover the hidden flag.

### Flag Format
```
acnctf{...}
```

`Good luck!`
