Layered QR
Difficulty- Medium

Some secrets aren’t written in plain sight — they hide between lines, shapes, and patterns. What you’ve been given looks like a set of ordinary QR codes, but looks can be deceiving.

Each image holds fragments of something bigger. Scan them, decode them, piece them together… but beware — the truth may not reveal itself immediately. Some codes may mislead, others may whisper clues, and some may demand that you look beyond the pixels.

Only those who understand how layers overlap, how patterns connect, and how details conceal meaning will find the hidden message. What you seek is not in one code — it lives in the way they interact.


Solution: 
The first step was to examine the provided GIFs. Use an online GIF splitter or Tools from ImageMagick to break the GIF image...where each GIF frame is divided into 9 images in a shuffled mode.

Reconstruct each frame by QR using 3x3 grid montage command 
scan each frame and get the parts of the flags


join it to get a meaningful flag 
Final Flag- ACNCTF{l@y3r$$_b3y0nd_v1s10n}
