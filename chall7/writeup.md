## Challenge Overview

This is a reverse engineering challenge consisting of multiple stages that require understanding and manipulating the program's logic to obtain the flag. The binary presents three main steps:

1\. Enter a magic number

2\. Provide a secondary code

3\. Solve a numeric puzzle



## Solution Breakdown



### Step 1: Finding the Magic Number

The program begins by asking for a magic number. In `main.c`, we see:

```c

int magic = 0x127bb26;

if (choice == magic) {

&nbsp;   // First step completed

}

```

The magic number is `0x127bb26` (hexadecimal), which converts to decimal `19381030`. This is the first input required.



### Step 2: Generating the Secondary Code

The secondary code is verified by the `checkSecondaryCode` function in `utils.c`. The function performs a complex calculation involving a magic value and the string "deadbeef". Let's analyze the function:



- The magic value is `(0x1234 << 12) | (0x7bb << 6) | 0x26`, which equals `0x127bb26` (same as Step 1).

- For each of the 8 characters in "deadbeef", it:

&nbsp; - Extracts a hex digit from the magic value (shifting appropriately)

&nbsp; - Converts the corresponding "deadbeef" character to its numeric value

&nbsp; - XORs the magic digit with the "deadbeef" digit

&nbsp; - Converts the result back to a hex character



We can compute the expected code by simulating this process:



```python

magic = 0x127bb26

deadbeef\_str = "deadbeef"

result = 0



for i in range(8):

&nbsp;   shift = 28 - ((i \& 0x7) << 2)

&nbsp;   magic\_digit = (magic >> shift) \& 0xF

&nbsp;   deadbeef\_char = deadbeef\_str\[i]

&nbsp;   deadbeef\_val = ord(deadbeef\_char) - ord('0') - (39 if deadbeef\_char > '9' else 0)

&nbsp;   xor\_val = magic\_digit ^ deadbeef\_val

&nbsp;   result\_char = chr(xor\_val + ord('0') + (39 if xor\_val > 9 else 0))

&nbsp;   result = (result << 8) | ord(result\_char)



# Convert result to string

expected = ''

for i in range(8):

&nbsp;   expected += chr((result >> (56 - (i << 3))) \& 0xFF)

```



Running this computation gives us the secondary code: `df8e5009`.



### Step 3: Solving the Numeric Puzzle

The final puzzle requires three numbers in the format "num1,num2,num3". The `solvePuzzle` function in `utils.c` processes these:



The intended solution for the puzzle is `117,238,55`, The Challegers Can easily get this by parsing through the code browser.



### Obtaining the Flag

After solving all three steps, the `giveFlag` function is called. It decrypts the flag using AES-CBC with a key derived from the puzzle solutions. The key is the concatenation of the three numbers as strings: `"11723855"`. Since the key must be 16 bytes, it is repeated to fill: `"1172385511723855"`.



The IV is all zeros. The encrypted flag is:

`58ba1477055ed24b6577e7bc0071b503efa064ee2cfede7755ecf772801331cf9da1f5997950cdb98b39041523efe6a4`



Decrypting with AES-CBC, key=`1172385511723855`, IV=`00000000000000000000000000000000` gives the flag:

`ACNCTF{X0r_Is_Fin3_Bu7_N07_4w3s0m3}`



## Summary of Steps

1\. Input the magic number: `19381030`

2\. Input the secondary code: `df8e5009`

3\. Solve the puzzle: `117,238,55`

4\. Receive the flag: `ACNCTF{X0r_Is_Fin3_Bu7_N07_4w3s0m3}`



## Final Answer

The flag is: `ACNCTF{X0r_Is_Fin3_Bu7_N07_4w3s0m3}`
