## Math or Brawn

In this challenge, participants are presented with a Python bytecode file. Executing the program and experimenting with inputs reveals that the correct solution consists of exactly four characters. Upon decompilation, a series of mathematical logic functions become apparent.

Attempting to solve the challenge by manual trial and error—inputting various guesses and analyzing the corresponding function outputs—is possible but extremely time-consuming. Notably, many leading AI systems have struggled to find the correct solution or come very close without success, even after extensive attempts.

The most efficient and straightforward approach is to write a simple brute force script, given that the solution length is clearly limited to four characters. An Example Script is Attached.
