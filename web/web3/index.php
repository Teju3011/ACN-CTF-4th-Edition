            <div class="story-text">
                <p>An underground organization has hidden secret intel inside their recruitment portal. Rumor says the portal verifies candidates by checking their 'Agent ID' in a classified database.</p>
                
                <p>But the system never reveals data directly â€” it only says whether the candidate exists or not. The only way to extract the hidden flag is by exploiting their sloppy backend code, which leaks information through timing/boolean behavior.</p>
                
                <p>Do you have what it takes to infiltrate their system and extract the classified information?</p>
