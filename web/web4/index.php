                <p>An underground organization has hidden secret intel inside their recruitment portal. The system has been recently upgraded with enhanced security protocols after multiple penetration attempts.</p>
                
                <p>The portal now features a silent verification system that provides no immediate feedback. However, rumors suggest that their internal document management system might still have vulnerabilities.</p>
                
                <p>Intelligence reports indicate that the organization stores sensitive data in their archives, and authorized personnel can access mission reports through their document viewer.</p>
                
                <p>Do you have what it takes to infiltrate their system and extract the classified information?</p>
