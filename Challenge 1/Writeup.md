# Challenge 1 â€“ Hidden Portraits

**Category:** Forensics / Steganography

**Diffculty Level:** Easy

**ðŸ“œ Description:**
  Sometimes what you see isnâ€™t what you get.
Two portraits gaze back at you â€” each carrying whispers of a secret.
One holds the key, buried beneath layers unseen.
The other guards the truth, transformed beyond recognition.
Unlock the first to awaken the second. Only then will the hidden message reveal itself â€” a trace of what once was, locked in a cryptic form.


**Flag format: ACNCTF{}**

**ðŸ”Ž Approach**

- Inspect the base64.png image using Hex Editor (Hex Analysis) or using strings in Linux or ubuntu.
You might find a passphrase as unlock_me.
- Encode the Passphrase using Base64 (clue from the image name)
- Extract the Hidden File (fingerprint.py) from Second Image using Steghide 
- Command - steghide extract -sf image1.jpeg
- It will ask for the passphrase which is the base64 encoded passphrase. Enter it and u will extract a .py file 
- Run the Extracted Python Script
- Command - python3 fingerprint.py
- **Output: flag{hidden_in_exif}**
- Convert the Flag to MD5sum. Based on the question or the clue convert the flag to MD5sum and wrap it in ACNCTF{} format.



âœ… Solution

The final flag is:
**ACNCTF{4ff54b43cd8ec104efdf2714199c0357}**
