# Digital Archaeology Lab - CTF Challenge

## Challenge Description
You stand amidst the ruins of a forgotten research facility, where whispers of an ancient digital civilization still linger. The scholars who once roamed these halls scattered their most sacred emblem across obscure corners, disguising it within the very fabric of their world.
Your task is to decipher their legacy. Only by piecing together these fractured relics can the true cultural identifier be restored.

## Hints
- Ancient civilizations often left traces in places others wouldn't look
- Sometimes the most valuable artifacts are hidden in plain sight, waiting for the right perspective
